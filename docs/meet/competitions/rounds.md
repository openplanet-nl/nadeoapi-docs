Gets rounds details for a competition ID.

---

**Remarks**:
- There are two different competition IDs which are both supported by this endpoint - the primary `id` is always numerical, while the `liveId` is a string typically starting with `"LID-COMP-`.
- If a round has a qualifier attached to it (e.g. the TA qualifier in COTD), its associated `challengeId` can be found in the `qualifierChallengeId` field. This is what you'd use to get more information about the qualifier, for example when [getting the qualifier leaderboards](/meet/challenges/leaderboard).
- To retrieve a round's matches (and their results), you can use [the round matches endpoint](/meet/competition-matches/matches-for-round).
