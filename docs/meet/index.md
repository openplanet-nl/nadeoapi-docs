# Meet API
The Meet API contains endpoints for interacting with competitions, matchmaking and other match infrastructure.

As of July 2023, it's the new umbrella API for the previous `competition`, `matchmaking` and `club` domains.

All of its endpoints require a token with the `NadeoClubServices` audience.
