method: GET
route: /api/matches/{matchId}/teams

      required: true
---

Gets team information for a given match ID.

---

**Remarks**:
- Match information is only stored on Nadeo's servers for about a month - afterwards, requesting it will only result in a `404` response code.
- There are two different match IDs which are both supported by this endpoint - the primary `id` is always numerical, while the `liveId` is a string typically starting with `"LID-MTCH-`.

**Example request**:
```plain
GET https://meet.trackmania.nadeo.club/api/matches/3018551/teams
```

**Example response**:
```json
[
    {
        "position": 0,
        "score": 0,
        "rank": 2
    },
    {
        "position": 1,
        "score": 5,
        "rank": 1
    }
]
```

If a `matchId` is invalid, the response will contain a `404` response code.
