Gets global matchmaking rankings for the specified type.

---

**Remarks**:
- The `matchmakingType` parameter is typically one of `2` (Ranked) or `3` (Royal). For a dynamic way of retrieving those IDs see [the matchmaking summary endpoint](/meet/matchmaking/summary).
- This leaderboard doesn't have the same restrictions as the map leaderboard endpoints - you can request any position and will get an accurate rank for each player.
- The `cardinal` field in the response is the total number of players in the ranking.
