Gets results for a given competition match ID.

---

**Remarks**:
- This endpoint only supports competition match IDs, which are different from regular match IDs (as found in [the match endpoints](/meet/matches)). They are numerical and have to be retrieved from a competition's rounds (see [here](/meet/competition-matches/matches-for-round)).
- If the match does not use teams, the `teams` field will be an empty array, and the `teamPosition` field for each player will be `null`.
- For proper team mappings and team names, refer to [the competition teams endpoint](/meet/competitions/teams).

If a `compMatchId` is invalid (or the match information is not available), the response will contain a `404` response code.
