# Guides

This section includes a few useful guides for some common use cases you can tackle with various Nadeo APIs.

Some may include reference implementations, but most of them focus on explaining general approaches to solving problems.

If you have suggestions or requests for specific guides, feel free to [reach out and get involved on Github](https://github.com/openplanet-nl/nadeoapi-docs), or [discuss it on Discord](https://openplanet.dev/link/discord).
