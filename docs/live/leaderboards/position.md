name: Get record positions by their time

url: https://live-services.trackmania.nadeo.live
method: POST
route: /api/token/leaderboard/group/map?scores[{mapUid}]={score}

audience: NadeoLiveServices

parameters:
  path:
    - name: mapUid
      type: string
      description: The UID of the map
      required: true
      max: 50 map UIDs
  query:
    - name: score
      type: integer
      description: The score/time to get the position for
      required: true
---

The request body is an array of maps, identified by their mapUids:
```json
{
  "maps": [
    {
      "mapUid": "{mapUid}",
      "groupUid": "Personal_Best"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

Gets position data for one or more records by their score/time.

---

**Remarks**:
- The `groupUid` `"Personal_Best"` can be used to get the global leaderboard.
- The `mapUid` parameter in the URL has to correspond with a map in the request body.
- This endpoint supports up to 50 maps at once - they need to be added to the request body's array as well as to the query parameters (see example below).
- This endpoint can sometimes be very delayed - there's been cases where it has returned data that was outdated for multiple hours. On average, this route should be up to date within about three hours - some maps are prioritized though (official campaign maps and current TOTDs), so they are typically updated every five minutes.

                "zoneName": "World",
                "ranking": {
                    "position": 294,
                    "length": 0
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "groupUid": "Personal_Best",
        "mapUid": "XiGZvMOqIgT3_g0TdeFa0lxMp46",
        "score": 17500,
        "zones": [
            {
                "zoneId": "301e1b69-7e13-11e8-8060-e284abfd2bc4",
                "zoneName": "World",
                "ranking": {
                    "position": 42,
                    "length": 0
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

If a `groupUid` or a `mapUid` is invalid, the response will simply omit that map's record.

If the query parameters reference a map that is not contained in the request body, the endpoint may return a `500` error.
